        Create a wellbeing-related Todoist task.

        This tool is specifically for caregiver wellbeing and self-care tracking. 
        Use it when the caregiver wants to *build healthy habits, manage stress, or remember self-care activities*.
        Examples:
        - "Remind me to drink water every 2 hours"
        - "Add a daily gratitude journal task at night"
        - "Track exercise three times a week"
        - "Set a task for deep breathing breaks tomorrow at 10 AM and 3 PM"

        Args:
            task_name (str): Clear name of the task, e.g. "Hydrate", "Evening Walk", "Journal Entry".
            task_due: Optional due date in natural language format (e.g. "tomorrow at 9 AM").
            priority (int, optional): Task urgency (1 = highest, 4 = lowest).
                - Use priority 1â€“2 for critical wellbeing activities (e.g., "Take medication", "Sleep at least 7h").
                - Use priority 3â€“4 for softer habits (e.g., journaling, mindfulness).
            labels (list, optional): List of wellbeing-related labels, e.g.
                - ["self-care", "exercise"]
                - ["hydration", "daily"]
                - ["mental health"]

        Returns:
            str: Success or error message from Todoist.

        Notes for the model:
            - Use this tool instead of `create_calendar_event` for *ongoing habits or personal tasks*.
            - If the activity is time-bound (e.g., therapy session, scheduled call), prefer `create_calendar_event`.
            - Default to daily recurrence if the caregiver describes a *routine wellbeing habit*.
            - Always confirm with the user before scheduling recurring tasks.
