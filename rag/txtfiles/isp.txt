Before you buy any Integrated Shield Plan (IP), CareShield Life (CSHL) and ElderShield (ESH) supplements, do consider carefully if you can afford the higher premiums as you grow older.

An Integrated Shield Plan (IP) combines MediShield Life with an additional private insurance coverage component provided by a private insurer.

You do not need an IP if you prefer Class B2 and C ward in public hospitals which provide heavy subsidies of up to 80% for Singaporeans.

Two-thirds of patients who are hospitalised opt for Class B2 and C wards (six to 10 bedders) in public hospitals. MediShield Life provides sufficient coverage for your large Class B2 and C bills.

If you prefer Class A and B1 wards (one to four bedders) in public hospitals or private hospitals, or to choose your own doctors, IP can offer supplementary coverage. Choose a plan which you can afford and meet your needs.

Can you afford IP premiums in the long run, as premiums rise substantially with age?

Your private medical insurance premiums could be up to five times of your MediShield Life premiums when you are in your 70s or 80s.

You’ll need to ensure that you can afford the higher premiums especially at older ages when you have stopped working. 

MediShield Life can cover your healthcare needs. Can you afford to pay cash for IP premiums which exceed the Additional Withdrawal Limits (AWLs)?

MediShield Life premiums can be fully paid with MediSave. You can only use MediSave up to the AWLs to pay for the IP premiums. Premiums above the AWLs will have to be paid in cash.

You’ll need to consider if you can afford to top up the differences in cash, especially at older ages when you have stopped working.

Choose the plan that best meets your needs and fits your budget.

Supplements complement your basic plan with additional benefits, such as higher monthly payouts.

As paying for a Supplement plan is a long-term commitment, you’ll need to ensure that you can afford to pay for the higher premiums in the long run, especially at older ages when you have stopped working.

If you need  supplementary coverage or benefits on top of your existing coverage, you may consider purchasing a Supplement plan. 

You may discuss with your financial advisor on your healthcare and financial planning.

Who can purchase Supplements and how can you pay for them?

Supplements can only be bought by existing CareShield Life or ElderShield policyholders. For Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, premiums can by paid by cash or by using the insured’s own or the insured’s family member’s (e.g. spouse, parents or children, sibling or grandchild) MediSave, up to a limit of $600 per calendar year per person insured.

If you can afford higher premiums, you can buy Supplement plans from three approved private insurers. When deciding on a plan, make sure you understand the differences in coverage, premiums, and claim limits.

The “Long-term care insurance” section on the Healthcare dashboard provides personalised information on your Supplement coverage. If you have a Supplement plan, this section will show the insurer of your Supplement, i.e. Singlife, Great Eastern or Income. Do contact your insurers to find out which Supplement plan you are covered under.
